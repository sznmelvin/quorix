Analyst Who Predicted The Bitcoin Rally Reveals Time To Sell,newsbtc,2024-09-21 18:00:25,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rally-time-to-sell/,"Bitcoin has performed well in the past few days after experiencing a strong downturn in the first two weeks of September. This rally kickstarted in the middle of this week after the Fed decided to slash the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points (bps), a move that proved positive for cryptocurrencies. Notably, this rally was already predicted by a few crypto analyst through technical indicators. One of such is Ali Martinez, who is a master of the TD Sequential. However, in an interesting turn of events, the analyst has highlighted the case for investors to “book some profits,” which is a sign of potential price correction up ahead. Analyzing The Bitcoin Rally Bitcoin, which struggled to gain momentum earlier in the month, entered a strong rally that began to take shape midweek. This rally saw Bitcoin break above $63,000 again and increase its market dominance. Furthermore, the rally peaked at $63,830, reflecting an increase of about 20.77% from a low of $52,827 on September 6. Related Reading: Grayscale XRP Trust Surges 11.44% One Week After Launch, Here’s The Catalyst However, despite the current optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s price action, Martinez has issued a word of caution to investors. In a post shared on social media platform X, Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential, a tool he frequently uses to analyze market trends, is now indicating the potential for a price correction near the $63,700 level. Martinez pointed out that the same TD Sequential indicator, which flashed a buy signal at $57,400 before Bitcoin’s recent rally, is now warning of a possible pullback. This suggests that while the recent surge has been remarkable, the market may be nearing a critical juncture where prices could retrace. The TD Sequential told you to buy #Bitcoin at $57,400, and now it is telling you to book some profits at $63,700! pic.twitter.com/0h1yNowkae — Ali (@ali_charts) September 20, 2024 Is It Time To Sell? Looking at Bitcoin’s price action since July, the $63,000, which acted as an order block earlier in the year, has largely acted as the beginning of a resistance level during price increases. However, while the TD Sequential signals a potential price correction, Bitcoin bulls are still testing the confirmation of a continued rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open interest Remains Muted Below $500 Million, What’s Going On? According to another analysis by Ali Martinez, Bitcoin is now testing the 200-day SMA, which is a critical level for confirming bull runs. History has shown that failure to break above the 200-day SMA has led to significant corrections in the past. If history were to repeat itself, this could lead to a correction towards $40,000 before the end of the year. Recent market dynamics and fundamentals have shown Bitcoin is now in a better place than it was in the past. There are now bullish catalysts within the ecosystem, like Spot Bitcoin ETFs, that would prevent a correction of such magnitude. Also, a green monthly close in September could better pave the way for a green ‘Uptober,’ leading to the continued rally in October. Nevertheless, the $63,000 and 200 SMA $63,900 price levels are important to watch for Bitcoin moving forward. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com"

As a result, Sui (SUI) is one asset whose price performance has largely gone under the radar in the last seven days. SUI Price Overview As of this writing, the price of SUI stands at $1.50, reflecting a more than 7.5% increase in the past 24 hours. This impressive single-day performance highlights the bullish momentum that the token has been enjoying over the past few weeks. The Sui token ranks amongst some of the best performers in the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the last seven-day period. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin is up by nearly 45% in the past week. Related Reading: Grayscale XRP Trust Surges 11.44% One Week After Launch, Here’s The Catalyst Interestingly, price action data shows that SUI’s hot streak is even more impressive on broader timeframes. Having started September consolidating around the $0.8 region, the token didn’t breach the $1 mark until about two weeks into the month. However, SUI didn’t take as much time to cross the $1.5 level, another major price landmark. Much of this positive performance can be attributed to the recent attention and adoption of the Sui blockchain in recent weeks. On September 17, Sui network revealed — in a post on the X platform — a notable partnership with Circle. The stablecoin providing is expanding USDC issuance to the layer 1 blockchain. This development is expected to boost liquidity and attract more users to the Sui network. Is $1.80 The Next Stop? As of now, the SUI token seems to be hovering around the psychological $1.5 region — which doubles as a major resistance zone. However, a convincing break above this level could mean a journey up to $1.80, where the next resistance level lies. In the case that the break above $1.5 is a fake out, the SUI token could fall to the next support level at $1.0125. It is worth noting that the relative strength index (RSI) indicator, which measures the momentum of a trend, is currently in the overbought region. Related Reading: Bullish Analyst Sees Cardano (ADA) Rising 13% As Key Indicator Signals Buy When the RSI value is above 70, it implies that the token’s price may be gearing for a correction or even a trend reversal. This observation suggests that investors might want to tread with caution, as the SUI token may just be overvalued at the moment. Nevertheless, the rising open interest has continued to fan the flames of bullish sentiment for SUI. According to data from Coinglass, the token’s open interest stands at around $383 million, reflecting an almost 9% increase in the past day. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView"
